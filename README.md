# Monospace 

This project develops an original monoscape type family with the base 4 styles, Regular/Italic/Bold/Bold-Italic, for the Latin script.

Developed explicitly for use in headline and display typography, the letterforms infuse a geometric slab core with novel over-rationalized forms. 

The Latin character set is Adobe Latin 3, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages. 

The project is led by Colophon, a type design foundry based in London and New York.
